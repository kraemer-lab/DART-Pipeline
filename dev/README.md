## Contributing guide for developers

Before contributing code you should make sure there is an Issue raised
corresponding to your change. If this is a feature request then it is best to
discuss the issue in github Discussions first, to ensure that it remains
in-scope for the core project.

Code contributions work through github pull requests. If you are unfamiliar with
pull requests please read the [github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en),
and specifically
[Creating a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

Pull requests made to the DART repository undergo a series of tests to
verify that the code works as expected and is of good quality. This includes unit-tests
for the different components, as-well as end-to-end testing on the
final pipelines (where practical).

Once your pull request has been made, check back to keep on eye on the test
outcomes which should complete within the hour.
You can continue to push commits to the same branch without closing
and reopening your pull-request if additional changes are needed. Once all tests
have passed you should request code review from one of the maintainers who will
provide feedback. Once all issues are resolved your pull-request will be merged
into the main branch of the codebase.
